            <p>For about a decade now, I've worked at Trader Joe's, wearing many hats throughout my time there.
                Trader Joe's is a bit a unique in that they don't staff onsite specialists to handle store
                administration.
                The store's managers –nicknamed "mates"– are trained on a wide range of responsibilities, including
                human resources, scheduling, and payroll.</p>
            <p>
                I like to think of my responsibilities as occupying different halves of my brain.
                My Right Brain has had a hand in hiring and onboarding new crew members,
                writing the store newsletter, and forming strong bonds of trust among coworkers and customers.
                My Left Brain learned how to forecast sales and place orders using proprietary software,
                identify consumer shopping trends, and merchandise sections to increase sales to reflect those trends.
